## Installation
Copy `custom.js` into your `%graph-name%/logseq/` folder.

## Additional notes
- `custom.js` has been introduced in logseq on 2021-11-10, see details here: https://github.com/logseq/logseq/pull/2943
- The `custom.js` file is **not** created by the default installer; it has to be created manually in `/logseq`.
- Before executing the code, the user will be asked for execution permission.
- When the content of the `custom.js` file is modified, it needs to be restarted or refreshed to take effect (cmd+shift+r).

![big red caret](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3d4a9834-828d-4756-bb06-17b7bca4448d)

## Installation
Copy `custom.js` into your `%graph-name%/logseq/` folder.

## Additional notes
- `custom.js` has been introduced in logseq on 2021-11-10, see details here: https://github.com/logseq/logseq/pull/2943
- The `custom.js` file is **not** created by the default installer; it has to be created manually in `%graph-name%/logseq/`.
- Before executing the code, the user will be asked for execution permission.
- Changes to the `custom.js` file require a restart or a refresh (Cmd+Shift+R) for logseq to reflect those changes.
